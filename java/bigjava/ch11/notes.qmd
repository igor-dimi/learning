# Reading and Writing Text Files 


Construct file object:

```java
File inputFile = new File("input.txt");
```

Construct a Scanner object to use the file objet:

```java
Scanner in = new Scanner(inputFile);
```

You can use scanner methods to process the file. E.g. to process numbers:

```java
while(in.hasNextDouble()) {
    double value = in.nextDouble();
    // Process value
}
```

To write ouput to a file, construct a `PrintWriter` object:

```java
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter("output.txt");
```

`PrintWriter` class is similar to the `PrintStream` class. 
`System.out` is a `PrintStream` object. Therefore you can use the familiar 
`print()`, `println()` etc methods:

```java
out.println("Hello, World!");
out.printf("Total: %8.2f%n", total);
```

Close the `Scanner` object `in` and the `PrintWriter` objects `out`:

```java
in.close();
out.
